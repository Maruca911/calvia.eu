UPDATE guides SET content = '<h2>Major Supermarket Chains in Calvia</h2>
<p>Calvia is well served by all the major Spanish supermarket chains, making weekly shopping straightforward whether you live in Santa Ponca or Peguera. <strong>Mercadona</strong> is the most popular chain with locations in Palmanova and Santa Ponca, offering excellent own-brand products at competitive prices. <strong>Eroski</strong> has a large hypermarket near Magaluf with a wide international food section. <strong>Lidl</strong> operates stores in Palmanova and near the Calvia Vila junction, and is particularly popular for its weekly special offers.</p>

<h2>Smaller and Specialty Shops</h2>
<p><strong>Aldi</strong> has expanded across the island and has a convenient branch near Santa Ponca. For a premium selection, <strong>El Corte Ingles</strong> in Palma (a short drive from most Calvia areas) has the best gourmet and imported foods department on the island, including British, German, and Scandinavian products.</p>
<p>Several independent shops cater to specific communities. You will find German delis and bakeries scattered around Peguera and Santa Ponca, British products at various ''international'' shops in Palmanova and Magaluf, and Scandinavian specialty items at select stores in Portals Nous.</p>

<h2>Fresh Markets and Local Produce</h2>
<p>The <strong>Monday market in Calvia Vila</strong> is one of the best weekly markets on the island. It runs from early morning until around 13:00 and offers fresh fruit, vegetables, olives, cheese, cured meats, flowers, clothing, and household items. Prices are generally lower than supermarkets for seasonal produce.</p>
<p>The <strong>Santa Ponca market</strong> operates on Saturdays and is smaller but well-curated. Peguera has a Tuesday market that is popular with both residents and tourists.</p>

<h2>Organic and Health Food</h2>
<p>Health-conscious shoppers can find organic produce at <strong>Herbolario</strong> shops found in most Calvia towns. For a wider selection, the Palma-based <strong>Veritas</strong> and <strong>Bio&Co</strong> stores stock certified organic produce, gluten-free products, and vegan alternatives. Most Mercadona stores now have a dedicated organic section as well.</p>

<h2>Practical Tips for Shopping in Calvia</h2>
<p>Spanish supermarkets typically close on Sundays, though some smaller shops may open in tourist areas during summer. Most stores observe a lunch break between 13:30 and 17:00 outside of the larger chains. Reusable bags are standard — bring your own or purchase one at checkout. Many stores accept card payments, but it is wise to carry some cash for market stalls and smaller shops.</p>',

UPDATE guides SET content = '<h2>Finding a Dentist in Calvia</h2>
<p>Calvia has a strong network of dental clinics serving both residents and visitors. Many clinics employ dentists who speak English, German, and other European languages — essential for the large international community. Most private dental clinics are concentrated in <strong>Santa Ponca, Palmanova, and Peguera</strong>, with a few practices in Portals Nous and Bendinat.</p>

<h2>Types of Dental Services Available</h2>
<p>Clinics in Calvia offer the full range of dental services you would expect in any modern European practice:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>General dentistry</strong> — checkups, cleanings, fillings, and extractions</li>
<li><strong>Cosmetic dentistry</strong> — whitening, veneers, and smile makeovers</li>
<li><strong>Orthodontics</strong> — traditional braces and Invisalign for adults and children</li>
<li><strong>Implants</strong> — single tooth implants and full-mouth rehabilitation</li>
<li><strong>Periodontics</strong> — gum disease treatment and maintenance</li>
<li><strong>Pediatric dentistry</strong> — specialized care for children</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cost Comparison</h2>
<p>Dental care in Spain is generally 30-50% less expensive than in the UK, Germany, or Scandinavia. A routine checkup and cleaning typically costs between 50 and 80 euros. A single dental implant (including crown) ranges from 900 to 1,800 euros depending on the clinic and materials used. Most clinics offer free initial consultations and will provide a detailed treatment plan with costs before beginning any work.</p>

<h2>Insurance and Payment</h2>
<p>Private health insurance in Spain often includes basic dental coverage, but many residents opt for a separate dental plan. Companies like <strong>Sanitas, Adeslas, and Asisa</strong> offer dental-specific plans starting from around 10-15 euros per month. Most clinics also offer interest-free payment plans for larger treatments.</p>
<p>If you have European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) or the UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC), note that dental care is not covered under the public health system in Spain except for emergencies and children under 15.</p>

<h2>Choosing the Right Clinic</h2>
<p>When selecting a dentist in Calvia, consider language capabilities, specializations, and whether the clinic uses modern technology such as digital X-rays and intraoral scanners. Online reviews from other international patients can be helpful. Many clinics listed on Calvia.app include language information and specialties in their profiles.</p>',

UPDATE guides SET content = '<h2>Why You Need a Local Lawyer in Calvia</h2>
<p>Whether you are buying property, setting up a business, or managing your residency status, having a trusted legal advisor who understands both Spanish law and the specific regulations of the Balearic Islands is essential. The legal landscape in Spain can be complex, particularly for international residents unfamiliar with the system.</p>

<h2>Common Legal Services for Internationals</h2>
<p><strong>Property law</strong> is the most frequently sought legal service in Calvia. A lawyer will handle title searches, contract review, due diligence on the property, and representation at the notary. Spanish property transactions require a lawyer to verify there are no outstanding debts, liens, or planning issues attached to the property.</p>
<p><strong>Residency and immigration</strong> — Lawyers assist with NIE applications, residency permits (both EU and non-EU), and the golden visa program for property investors. Post-Brexit, British residents have needed particular guidance on the new TIE card process.</p>
<p><strong>Tax planning</strong> — International residents often have complex tax situations spanning multiple jurisdictions. A good lawyer will work alongside tax advisors to ensure compliance with both Spanish and home-country obligations. Key areas include wealth tax, income tax declarations, and inheritance tax planning.</p>
<p><strong>Business formation</strong> — Setting up a company in Spain (typically an SL, the Spanish equivalent of a limited company) requires legal guidance. Lawyers handle articles of incorporation, registration with the Registro Mercantil, and ongoing corporate compliance.</p>
<p><strong>Inheritance and wills</strong> — Spanish inheritance law differs significantly from other European countries. Making a Spanish will is strongly recommended for anyone owning property in Spain, even if you have a will in your home country.</p>

<h2>Languages and Specializations</h2>
<p>Many law firms in Calvia employ multilingual lawyers. English and German speakers are particularly well represented, reflecting the demographics of the area. Some firms specialize exclusively in serving the international community, while others are traditional Spanish practices that have expanded to include foreign-language services.</p>

<h2>Fee Structure</h2>
<p>Legal fees in Calvia typically follow one of two models: hourly rates (ranging from 120 to 250 euros per hour depending on seniority) or fixed fees for standard procedures (such as 1-1.5% of property price for conveyancing). Always request a clear fee agreement before engaging services. Initial consultations are often free or charged at a reduced rate.</p>

<h2>How to Choose a Lawyer</h2>
<p>Verify that any lawyer you engage is registered with the <strong>Ilustre Colegio de Abogados de Baleares</strong> (Balearic Bar Association). Ask for references from other international clients, and ensure the firm has experience with your specific legal need. Many firms listed on Calvia.app include their specializations and language capabilities in their profiles.</p>',

UPDATE guides SET content = '<h2>Remote Work in Calvia: An Overview</h2>
<p>Calvia has emerged as one of Mallorca''s most attractive locations for remote workers and digital nomads. The combination of reliable high-speed internet, modern coworking facilities, excellent weather, and a thriving international community makes it a compelling base for location-independent professionals.</p>

<h2>Coworking Spaces</h2>
<p>Several dedicated coworking spaces have opened across Calvia in recent years. <strong>Santa Ponca and Palmanova</strong> have the highest concentration of options, ranging from casual hot-desking environments to premium private offices. Most spaces offer day passes (typically 15-25 euros), monthly memberships (150-300 euros), and dedicated desks (250-400 euros). Meeting rooms, printing, and high-speed Wi-Fi are standard amenities.</p>
<p>Some hotels and beach clubs also offer daytime working packages that include Wi-Fi, power outlets, and a drink or two — a popular option during the warmer months.</p>

<h2>Internet and Connectivity</h2>
<p>Fiber-optic internet is widely available across Calvia, with speeds of 300-600 Mbps common in most residential areas. Major providers include <strong>Movistar, Vodafone, Orange, and MasMovil</strong>. For temporary residents, 4G/5G mobile data plans from providers like Lycamobile or Simyo offer a quick setup option. Most cafes and restaurants offer free Wi-Fi, though speeds and reliability vary.</p>

<h2>Best Cafes for Working</h2>
<p>If you prefer the cafe-office lifestyle, Calvia has no shortage of options. Look for places with outdoor terraces, reliable Wi-Fi, and a relaxed attitude towards laptop workers. The specialty coffee shops in <strong>Portals Nous, Santa Ponca, and Peguera</strong> tend to be the most laptop-friendly. Peak lunch hours (13:00-15:00) can be busy, so arrive early to secure a good spot.</p>

<h2>Spain''s Digital Nomad Visa</h2>
<p>Spain introduced the <strong>digital nomad visa</strong> in 2023, allowing non-EU remote workers to live and work in Spain for up to five years. Key requirements include a minimum income threshold (approximately 2,520 euros per month), proof of remote employment or freelance contracts with companies outside Spain, and health insurance coverage. The visa also includes a favorable tax regime for the first four years. Several law firms in Calvia specialize in processing these applications.</p>

<h2>Networking and Community</h2>
<p>The remote work community in Calvia is active and welcoming. Regular networking events, co-working meetups, and professional gatherings are organized through local Facebook groups, Meetup.com, and the coworking spaces themselves. The international nature of the community means you will meet professionals from dozens of countries, creating natural opportunities for collaboration and friendship.</p>

<h2>Practical Considerations</h2>
<p>Time zone compatibility with European and African markets is excellent. Working with US-based clients is manageable but requires shifting your schedule later into the evening. The cost of living in Calvia is moderate by European standards — lower than most northern European cities but higher than mainland Spain.</p>',

UPDATE guides SET content = '<h2>Finding Reliable Home Services in Calvia</h2>
<p>One of the biggest challenges for international residents in Calvia is finding trustworthy tradespeople and home service providers. Word of mouth remains the primary way most people find reliable professionals, but online directories like Calvia.app are making the process easier by connecting you with vetted local businesses.</p>

<h2>Plumbing and Heating</h2>
<p>Plumbing issues are common in Mallorca, particularly in older properties. Licensed plumbers (<strong>fontaneros</strong>) handle everything from leaky taps to complete bathroom renovations. Emergency callout rates typically range from 80-150 euros, with standard hourly rates of 35-60 euros. When hiring a plumber, always ask for their <strong>carnet de instalador</strong> (installer license) issued by the Balearic government. Hot water systems in Calvia range from electric boilers to solar thermal panels — a qualified plumber can advise on the best option for your property.</p>

<h2>Electricians</h2>
<p>Spanish electrical standards differ from those in northern Europe and the UK. Only hire a licensed electrician (<strong>electricista autorizado</strong>) for any electrical work. Common jobs include upgrading fuse boxes for modern appliances, installing air conditioning units, and adding outdoor lighting. Expect to pay 30-50 euros per hour. For major installations, always request a <strong>boletin electrico</strong> (electrical certificate) upon completion.</p>

<h2>Cleaning Services</h2>
<p>Regular home cleaning is widely available in Calvia. Independent cleaners typically charge 12-18 euros per hour, while professional cleaning companies charge 15-25 euros per hour. For holiday rental properties, specialized cleaning services offer turnover cleaning with linen changes. Most cleaning professionals prefer to work under a formal contract (<strong>contrato de trabajo</strong>) which provides both parties with legal protection and social security coverage.</p>

<h2>Garden and Pool Maintenance</h2>
<p>Many properties in Calvia have gardens and pools that require regular maintenance. Garden services (<strong>jardineria</strong>) typically include lawn mowing, hedge trimming, irrigation system maintenance, and seasonal planting. Monthly garden maintenance for an average property costs 100-250 euros depending on garden size. Pool maintenance is essential from April through October — expect to pay 80-150 euros per month for weekly chemical testing, filter cleaning, and general upkeep.</p>

<h2>Pest Control</h2>
<p>The Mediterranean climate brings certain pest challenges. <strong>Processionary pine caterpillars</strong> (February-April) are a genuine hazard for pets and children. Professional nest removal is recommended. Cockroaches, mosquitoes, and ants are seasonal visitors that can be managed with regular professional treatments. Most pest control companies offer annual contracts with quarterly visits.</p>

<h2>Tips for Hiring Home Services</h2>
<p>Always request a written quote (<strong>presupuesto</strong>) before work begins. Ask for references from other international clients. Verify that the professional has proper insurance (<strong>seguro de responsabilidad civil</strong>). For larger projects, get at least three quotes. Payment terms are typically 50% deposit and 50% on completion. Building a relationship with reliable tradespeople is one of the most valuable things you can do as a homeowner in Calvia.</p>',

Many of these products make excellent gifts and can be found at markets, specialty shops, and directly from producers.</p>

<h2>Practical Shopping Tips</h2>
<p>Most shops close for siesta between 13:30 and 17:00, reopening until 20:00 or 20:30. In tourist areas during summer, many shops stay open through lunch.
